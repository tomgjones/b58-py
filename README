This is an almost-complete implementation of b58(1) and b58-dec(1)
as defined at
<https://github.com/tomgjones/b58-interface>.

This implementation is written in Python 3.

I haven't been able to implement the `b58 --bytes` option yet, as
Python 3 seems to lack an interface to the raw bytes in argv.
